- use a blank base-box (http://www.vagrantbox.es/)
- add puppet-rvm module for ruby management
- look at rodjek repos
- have a look at librarian-puppet
- add versions to modules (mysql, apache passenger)
- try using hiera for passwords and keys
- extract only parts from configs, that really change
  - sites_enabled
  - mysql (what file was that?)
