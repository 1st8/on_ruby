- add puppet-rvm module for ruby management
- add puppet-lint gem and use it (add it to SublimeLinter at best)
- try puppet-rspec and check if that makes sense
- look at rodjek repos
- have a look at librarian-puppet
- try using hiera for passwords and keys
- extract only parts from configs, that really change
  - sites_enabled
  - mysql (what file was that?)
- have a look at brightbox puppet modules
